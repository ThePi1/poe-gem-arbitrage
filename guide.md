# Gem Arbitrage 1002: A 2-credit course for money-minded individuals

See below for some tips and tricks about using this tool to make money.

## Repeat vs. Single lens Use
What's all this about 'single' vs 'repeat' gem use?
Single refers to buying a gem, using a lens, and discarding the result if it doesn't hit.
Multiple refers to buying a gem, and using lenses on it until you hit the result.

TL;DR: I don't like the single use strategy, I think it's a waste of time in bulk, I go multiple where possible.

One of the most important decisions / considerations when using the tool is the above 'single' vs. 'multiple' lens use methods.

Some trades might be more profitable when using the multiple vs. the single use method. It all comes down to:
- Quality weights
- QOL for trading and actually making money (seriously)

Usually, gems with alt qualities have basically one valuable quality. I think, in general, it's a waste of time (time is money!) to buy up gems just to use a single lens on them and throw away. Most base gems aren't available in massive bulk quantities easily or cheaply. (Some exceptions like CWDT or Inspiration as of writing this.) This is especially true for gems that have average tries > 4 or more.

In most cases, there is really no reclamation of value by selling the intermediate product anyways. Sort of like how, sometimes, (back in the old days), you'd sell 5 links on the way to the 6 link. There just is no market for most of the intermediate (not-super-valuable) qualities, and you'll be stuck holding garbage.

#### 'M1' vs. 'M2' sorting methods
TL;DR: You probably want it on 'M2', but if you need to switch over to generating more skill gems to sell, switch it to 'M1'.
Let's start by reviewing how the two methods work.

Method 1 (M1) - Sort and display trades based on the total profit per success.

Method 2 (M2) - Sort and display trades based on the profit per lens use.

These two methods allow you to sort by different metrics depending on how you value your time. Generally speaking, if your trading time is the limiting factor -- you want to optimize for the profit per lens use, because that equates to profit per lens bought.

If, on the other hand, selling gems is the limiting factor, then you want to optimize for the profit per sale, because a sale made is a gem created.

There is a good chunk of skill gems with reasonably high multiple-lens costs (right around 6), that might not have a very high per-lens profit, but have a decently high per-gem profit. If you're making gems faster than you're selling them, you may want to switch over to a slower to create gem.
